      <h2>Module 1 Reflection</h2>
      <h3>1/20/2017</h3>
      <p>
        Overall I would say that my experience in Module 1 was positive. It was challenging, but the process of overcoming those challenges was extremely gratifying. There is an incalculable amount of information to learn, which is something that has driven me in this program. I rediscovered my passion for programming over the last few weeks, and am really excited to see what Mod 2 has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite technical concept from Module 1 is the idea of object oriented programming. My prior programming experience did not really prepare me for the conceptual understanding that I developed from learning ruby this Mod. I remember distinctly the ‘aha’ moment when I came to the realization that an object is kind of like an active data type. It has the capacity to both store data and perform operations on that data. When I had this realization it helped me better conceptualize the functionality that can be produced from objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say that I learned a lot over the past few weeks would be an understatement. Facing and overcoming the challenges given to me over the course of Module 1 has reignited my desire to learn and explore programming, but more importantly it has made me hopeful.
