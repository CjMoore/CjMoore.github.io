      <h2>Open Source Reflection</h2>
      <h3>6/8/2017</h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of my time at Turing I have contributed to two open source projects. Generally speaking I find open source projects to be an incredibly interesting. They are an opportunity to learn about collaboration and brown-field development, as well as establishing a connection to the dev community. I'm really happy that I had the opportunity to contribute to larger projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my second Module at Turing Casey, Katy, and I worked with two Mod4 frontend people to develop a backend for their capstone project. The application was called One Nation Many Voices, and it displayed data about town hall meetings. We used a publicly availiable document to seed a database and exposed the data so the frontend could render it. I was really excited to work on this project because it encouraged civic engagement, which is something that I am passionate about.

        In the last couple of weeks I contributed to the Faker gem as well. I created a new category of faker for Elder Scrolls. This includes the ability to randomly generate race, creatures, and dragons. Faker was really fun to work on. It required tests and documentation, which are two things that I like. Contributing to faker gave me a new perspective on how libraries are built, and the power of open source with respect to how it brings people together.

      <h2>Module 2 Reflection</h2>
      <h3>3/7/2017</h3>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed learning how to use Rails in Mod2. It was fun to build things that I could interact with in the browser. I feel like I developed a strong understanding of the material, and a strong foundation on which to build new skills. The pace at which we were presented with the material was manageable, and made the entire Mod much more relaxed than the previous one. I felt much more engaged, and much more willing to ask questions, which I think benefited my learning tremedously.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite technical concept that I learned over this Mod was about the HTTP request response cycle. Before our lessons on how the internet worked I really had no idea what was happening behind the scenes. I feel empowered by my basic understanding to dig deeper and learn more about the subject as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Mod has been enlightening in many ways. I learned a lot about the way I collaborate with teammates, and the workflow of a collaborative project. I learned how to create basic web applications, and databases. And I learned how to use my creativity to produce something new and unique.

      <h2>Module 1 Reflection</h2>
      <h3>1/20/2017</h3>
      <p>
        Overall I would say that my experience in Module 1 was positive. It was challenging, but the process of overcoming those challenges was extremely gratifying. There is an incalculable amount of information to learn, which is something that has driven me in this program. I rediscovered my passion for programming over the last few weeks, and am really excited to see what Mod 2 has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite technical concept from Module 1 is the idea of object oriented programming. My prior programming experience did not really prepare me for the conceptual understanding that I developed from learning ruby this Mod. I remember distinctly the ‘aha’ moment when I came to the realization that an object is kind of like an active data type. It has the capacity to both store data and perform operations on that data. When I had this realization it helped me better conceptualize the functionality that can be produced from objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say that I learned a lot over the past few weeks would be an understatement. Facing and overcoming the challenges given to me over the course of Module 1 has reignited my desire to learn and explore programming, but more importantly it has made me hopeful.
